Polynomial root finder binary time complexity
At some point during my Bachelors degree I created a root finder based on three mathematical theorems:
Darboux theorem, Sturms theorem and the Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem.
Even though the solution is not the prittiest I guess it was a creative enough approach to a rootfinder (without the use of matrixes) 
I had the opportunity to present it in front of some MIT visiting professors which is quite a flex to this day :'))
